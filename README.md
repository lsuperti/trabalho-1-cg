## Running the application
Requirements:
- Node.js
- npm

To run this application the required npm dependencies must be installed.
To do this, run `npm install` in the project directory.
After that, the application server can be started for local hosting with `npm start`, a browser window will automatically open with the running application.

## Development
For development it is possible to use a server with live reload, this server should never be used in production as it has several known security issues and is explicitly not intended for final deployment.
To preserve the npm audit system, this package was not added to the project, so it must be installed globally. To do this, run `npm install -g live-server`.
After that, the live server can be started by running `npm run live` or `npx live-server` in the project directory.
